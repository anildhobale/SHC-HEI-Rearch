HEALING EFFICIENCY INDEX (HEI)
A Proprietary Unified Metric Combining Structural, Durability, and Functional Efficacy

1. Introduction
Self-healing concrete and cementitious composites require quantitative, unified performance evaluation beyond isolated recovery parameters. Existing studies typically report individual indicators such as stiffness recovery, crack closure, or permeability reduction, which do not provide a holistic measure of healing performance.

To address this limitation, the Healing Efficiency Index (HEI) is proposed as a proprietary, dimensionless, and unified metric that integrates structural resilience, durability restoration, and functional crack sealing into a single evaluative index.

2. Definition of Healing Efficiency Index (HEI)
HEI = 0.40 × (Er / E0) + 0.30 × (S0 / Sr) + 0.30 × (1 − wr / w0)

Description

Measurement Method

E0

Er

Ultrasonic Pulse Velocity (UPV)

S0

Initial water sorptivity

ASTM C1585

Sr

wr

Residual crack width after healing

4. Performance Components and Weighting Rationale
Structural Resilience (40%): Quantified through elastic modulus recovery, representing the material’s ability to restore stiffness and load transfer.

Durability Restoration (30%): Evaluated using water sorptivity reduction, indicating improved resistance to moisture ingress and durability deterioration.

Functional Integrity (30%): Measured by crack width reduction, reflecting effective crack sealing.

5. Interpretation and Acceptance Criteria
HEI ≥ 0.70 : Effective self-healing – Acceptable
0.50 ≤ HEI < 0.70 : Partial healing – Conditional acceptance
HEI < 0.50 : Ineffective healing – Rejected

6. Advantages of the HEI Framework
- Unified assessment of self-healing performance
- Based on standardized and repeatable test methods
- Eliminates single-parameter bias
- Applicable for research, QA/QC, and performance-based specifications

7. Intellectual Property Notice
The Healing Efficiency Index (HEI) is a proprietary performance metric. The formulation, weighting scheme, and decision thresholds are original and intended for academic and research use with proper attribution.
